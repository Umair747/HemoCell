Choose bending force implementation. This is a numerical modelling choice.
[1] - Local only bending implementation acting on the two opposing vertices of the surfaces with the bending angle.
[2] - Distributed bending using all four vertices with wieghting.
[3] - Distributed bending using all four vertices.
Note: 	[1] is advised for cases where structural rigidity is needed. 
		[2] is an intermediate modell between [1] and [3] using four vertices, however, weighting them. So far seem to be the best option.
		[3] is useful for having increased numerical stability (req.: dx<= 0.5 um, otherwise oscillates).
