Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: My cells are not initialized at the right position
-----------------------------------------------------

This is possible due to the lattice spacing usually (unless defined otherwise)
being 0.5 µm while the positions in the ``.pos`` file are in µm. This means
that a cell center of ``10 12 24`` in a ``.pos`` file will have a center of
``20 24 48`` in the simulation.

Q: Can the cells lie out of the domain?
---------------------------------------

Yes, cells are bound inside the domain by their centerpoints, so parts of the
cell might reach over the domain. These cells are deleted during initialisation.


Q: What is the exact centerpoint of the domain, how big is my domain?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When you specify a domain of for example 10 cells, the exact
middle will be *BETWEEN* cell 5 and 6. imagine that dx is 0.5µm then the domain
is 9.5µm long, and the middle is 4.75µm. periodic boundaries of course add 1 dx
back to the length.
